# TODO

items tracking to be done

Flagfile-Parser

- [ ] date > timestamp comparison
- [ ] parse NOW function
- [ ] evaluator for Flagfile
- [ ] restructure and rename project into Flagfile.rs / into workspaces
- [ ] introduce new comparison ops - regex match (and does not match), contains (and does not contain)

Flagfile-CLI

- [ ] flagfile validate
- [ ] flagfile init
- [ ] flagfile list
- [ ] built-in ui to edit and save flagfile in current dir
- [ ] flagfile find // find all flagnames within current directory source code recursively
        like you would do with grep or ripgrep with regex /(FF[-_].*)\s?->/
- [ ] make it so you can install flagfile-cli with brew or shell script
- [ ] flagfile fmt
- [ ] flagfile test (will look for flagfile.tests file and run those)

Flagfile-Relay

- [ ] Server options: gRPC (tonic), rest (axum), redis (pretend to be redis), flagfile cdn
  - [ ] server as cdn can serve this as flagfile or converted through converter into other framework (like launchdarkly or .net flagging)
- [ ] Pullers: pulling from cdn, from github, SSE - listening for update as server side events
- [ ] Create lightweight side-car container for this
- [ ] Look into if we can transform AST of feature flags into json structure launchdarkly uses and force ld-relay to pull state from our apis instead so client libraries doesnt need to change. similar to what dorklyorg/dorkly does with yaml files

Flagfile other crazy ideas

- [ ] Compile into other framework languages something like you have Flagfile and then convert to .net feature flagging

- [x] support for single quote strings
- [x] evaluation with provided context
- [x] date comparisons
- [x] parse comments in function body under rules
